## How do you merge courses?

Sometimes two courses become one course. There's two things you can do.

**Example 1: still keep the cards separate**

In _2018/19_, when **Informatics 1: Functional Programming (INF1-FP)** and **Informatics 1: Computation and Logic (INF1-CL)** merged to become **Informatics 1: Introduction to Computation**, we just kept them as separate sections in Better Informatics.

We did this because even though administratively (system-wise) the course was one course; the lecturers remained distinct, with separate lectures, labs and tutorials.

This is OK, because even newer students that never saw INF1-FP and INF1-CL still refer to each half of the course as FP and CL.

**Example 2: actually merge the cards**

In _2019/20_, when **Computer Architecture (CAR)** and **Computer Design (CD)** merged to become **Computer Architecture and Design (CARD)**, we chose to merge them into one section.

This is because these two courses were truly merged together to form a new course. (Well, at least qaisjp hopes this is the case.)

It's worth noting that in this case the lecturers from both courses are now running **CARD**, which is similar to how the lecturers shared the course in Example 1 (INF1A).

Unfortunately, the course content is hidden on Learn to those not taking the course. So qaisjp can't actually check if they are distinct.

Usually actually merging the cards together is the best option. The code doesn't get confused, and neither do users.
