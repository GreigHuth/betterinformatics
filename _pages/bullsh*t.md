# Bullsh*t courses [\[edit\]](https://github.com/compsoc-edinburgh/betterinformatics/blob/master/_pages/bullsh*t.md)

These are courses that are "easy". This might mean they are easy to learn, but not necessarily easy to master or do well on. It depends!
"Bullsh\*t" can be stuff that you can easily figure out or courses where you can just blag (e.g. professional issues).

This is, of course, completely subjective.
Maybe this list should be filterable/sortable by "key skills" (such as "mathematics", "programming", etc.)

## Level 8 (1st and 2nd year)

- [Logic 1](http://www.drps.ed.ac.uk/19-20/dpt/cxphil08004.htm) - this is a PPLS course. "computation & logic, but for ppls students". this still requires a bit of practice, though!

## Level 9 (3rd year)

## Level 10 (3rd and 4th year)

- [Database Systems (DBS)](/inf3#dbs) - but they knock off marks for dumb reasons like forgetting semicolons
- [Software Testing (ST)](/inf3#st) - don't expect to learn real software testing
