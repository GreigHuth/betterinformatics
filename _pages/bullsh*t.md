# Bullsh*t courses [\[edit\]](https://github.com/compsoc-edinburgh/betterinformatics/blob/master/_pages/bullsh*t.md)

These are courses that are "easy". This might mean they are easy to learn, but not necessarily easy to master or do well on. It depends!

This is, of course, completely subjective.
Maybe this list should be filterable/sortable by "key skills" (such as "mathematics", "programming", etc.)

## Level 9

## Level 10

- [Database Systems (DBS)](/inf3#dbs) - but they knock off marks for dumb reasons like forgetting semicolons
- [Software Testing (ST)](/inf3#st) - don't expect to learn real software testing
