## Where is my course?
Each course is put in a folder with the year that Informatics lists the course to be run for. You can view all courses and their associated years at course.inf.ed.ac.uk.

## Please!
Do not convert PDFs to a Google Doc, leave them as PDF files.

## Sharing

When you share a link (see types of links below), only people who are added to the Better Informatics Team Drive have access.

| Type    | Example URL                                                                                                                                                                      |
|---------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Folders | [https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/**0AIKEqWfeWuQQUk9PVA**](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/0AIKEqWfeWuQQUk9PVA)                                             |
|   Files | [https://docs.google.com/document/d/**1W1xVJs_RvV3KBbk1bKjsDvYUyUitER4jVbuae-nUFx8**/edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1W1xVJs_RvV3KBbk1bKjsDvYUyUitER4jVbuae-nUFx8/edit) |

If you share one of the above links directly, users without access will be presented with the below interface:

    <img alt="Google Drive request access" src="https://i.imgur.com/DYAMx8ol.png">
  </a>
</center>

**This is bad!** There is an automated system to add users to the Team Drive.


You can just click the <a href="/drive" style="padding: 0 0.5em;" class="btn"><strong>new</strong> team drive</a> button at the top, and this will just prompt you to log in and associate your
Informatics DICE account (to prove you're an inf student) with a Google account (to use Google Drive).

**If you would like to directly send a link to someone in a group chat**... copy the bolded bit in the URLs above and paste
it in the section indicated below by `ID_HERE`:


```
https://betterinformatics.com/drive?next=ID_HERE
```

For example, the following URL `https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/0AIKEqWfeWuQQUk9PVA` would
produce `https://betterinformatics.com/drive?next=0AIKEqWfeWuQQUk9PVA`.
