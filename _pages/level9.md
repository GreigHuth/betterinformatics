## Honesty Jar notes

I (Qais) personally think it would be nice to have a little snack bar.
Obviously each snack would be added to the price list and people would
have to pay for them.

It would be cool if we could get Inf to subsidise, but for now, we will have to buy own stuff.

We were thinking about milk & tea:
- obviously, it's hard to charge for milk
- for tea, Ginte bought a 400(?) pack box that cost £5.
  Adding a 2p charge per teabag is silly, so her solution was to just deduct £5
  from how much she owes the honesty jar. That's a fantastic solution, in my opinion.

So the rule of thumb so far is:
- if it's perishable & immeasurable (i.e. milk), it doesn't get put on the price list
- individual stuff like cans of coke, chocolate bars, etc, DOES get put on the price list
- if you buy something for the floor, and you're certain it does get used
  (or if you're unsure, observe it getting used), feel free to
  deduct the cost from the Honesty Jar Bank of Informatics!
- super cheap stuff shouldn't get put on the price list. let's say the minimum spend is 10p for now?
